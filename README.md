# Powershell
Implements some handy features for git and powershell. These are the following cmdlets added:
- reload: Restarts your current powershell session which is useful when you want to reload your current profile settings (profile.ps1).
- gpp: Runs g++ with a set of flags useful for debugging.
- git_account: Displays the currently logged in git account.
- git_login: Used to log in to a new git account.

# How to use
Run edit_profile.ps1 by typing .\edit_profile.ps1 in powershell. This should write all content in ps_git.ps1 to your powershell profile.
